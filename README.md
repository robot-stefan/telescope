# Telescope
A 3d printed newtonian telescope I designed and built as a personal project. Some quick highlights: the unit features baffleing down the optical tube assembly, can be printed in the volume of a Prusa MK3S or similarly sized printer, and is modular in construction allowing for dissassembly.
