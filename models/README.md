Procurment:
- I had good success with many of the amazon warehouse / used options particularly for the Celestron branded parts. 
- B######## Are the amazon ASIN numbers. You will also see them in the URL and they can be pasted into the search box.

[^1]: This part was dissassembled and portions of it were used.
[^2]: Only around 1/2 were used during build up.
[^3]: Not a heat or press fit. These slide in. If you end up using glue in your print only use a small amount. Glue wicking into an 80 thread per inch thread will prevent function.
